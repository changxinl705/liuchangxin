<h2>Robust Model Predictive Control and Scheduling Co-design for Cyber-physical Systems </h2>
<p></p>
<div class="infoblock">
<div class="blockcontent">
<p>In modern cyber-physical systems (CPSs) where the control signals are generally transmitted via shared communication networks, there is a desire to balance the closed-loop control performance with the communication cost necessary to achieve it. In this context, aperiodic real-time scheduling of control tasks comes into being and has received increasing attention recently. It is well known that model predictive control (MPC) is currently widely utilized in industrial control systems and has greatly increased profits in comparison with the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control. As communication and networks play more and more important roles in modern society, there is a great trend to upgrade and transform traditional industrial systems into CPSs, which naturally requires extending conventional MPC to communication-efficient MPC to save network resources. Motivated by this fact, this project is dedicated to developing robust MPC and scheduling co-design algorithms for networked CPSs affected by both parametric uncertainties and additive disturbances.
