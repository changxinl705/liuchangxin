<h2>Robust Model Predictive Control and Scheduling Co-design for Cyber-physical Systems </h2>
<div class="infoblock">
<div class="blockcontent">
<p>In modern cyber-physical systems (CPSs) where control inputs are generally transmitted via shared communication networks, there is a desire to balance the closed-loop control performance with the communication cost necessary to achieve this performance. In conventional periodic control, the measurement signal is sampled with a fixed time period, and the control signal is calculated and implemented periodically without considering dynamical characteristics of the system. This may result in greater utilization of computation and communication resources than it necessarily needs. In this context, aperiodic real-time scheduling of control tasks comes into being and has received increasing attention recently. It is well known that model predictive control (MPC) is currently widely utilized in the industrial control systems and has greatly increased profits in comparison with PID control. As communication and networks play more and more important roles in modern society, there is a great trend to upgrade and transform traditional industrial systems into CPSs, which naturally requires extending conventional MPC to communication-efficient MPC to save network resources. Motivated by this fact, we in this project propose a robust MPC and scheduling co-design framework to constrained systems possibly affected by both parameter uncertainties and disturbances.</p>
